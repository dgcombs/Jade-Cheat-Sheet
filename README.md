# Jade Cheat Sheet
Although Jade is not necessary for running Express under Node,
it is cool. But I keep forgetting the rules. This cheat sheet is
designed to help me remember how to code HTML in Jade.

## Requirements
Of course, it struck me as obvious that the most sensible way to
define a cheat sheet would be to write it *IN* Jade so if I needed
more examples of the requirements, they would be right there.

* [Node](http://www.nodejs.org)
* [Jade](http://www.jade-lang.com)

And, my fine friends, that's all there is to it!
